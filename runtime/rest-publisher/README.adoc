== The Spring Roo REST Publisher

This module provides a REST API to access various Spring Roo resources such as 
commands and project information.

The REST API is used internally by the Eastern Grey UI and can support any 
custom client application that requires interaction with Roo.

The HTTP port is configurable and may be set in $ROO_HOME/conf/config.properties. 
The default port is 9191.

REST API is exposed under the /rs-api context path.

=== How it works

The `ResourceTracker` `ServiceTracker` tracks OSGi services that are annotated 
with the JAX-RS annotations `@Path`/`@Provider` or it extends
`javax.ws.rs.core.Feature`.

Then it hooks these services into Jersey Servlet container and the OSGi 
HTTP service, that is, it publishes them as RESTful web services.
